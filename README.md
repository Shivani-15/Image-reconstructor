# Image-reconstructor
Denoising auto-encoder

### Problem Statement ###
Gaussian noise arises in an image due to factors such as electronic circuit noise and sensor noise due to poor illumination or high temperature. The purpose is to reconstruct clear images from those noisy images. 

### Dataset ###
MNIST dataset consisting 70,000 28x28 black-and-white images of handwritten digits.

### Model ###
A denoising autoencoder consisting of 11 layers.
